title: "Towards Studying the Communication Patterns of Kanban Teams: A Research Design"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-09-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Communication among agile software development teams is knit around the requirements (user stories) and is considered vital for information sharing. Researchers have studied communication among agile teams from various perspectives including team distribution, distance, and communication patterns etc. It is worth noticing here that most of the advances done in this domain are for Scrum teams. However, minimal work has been done on exploring the communication among Kanban teams. Since, software industry is taking a big leap from Scrum to Kanban and this encourages us to investigate and find interesting insights on Kanban teams' communication. Therefore, in this study we present our roadmap to study communication patterns of Kanban teams. We believe that the findings of the study will contribute to strengthen the understanding on the topic and will also provide a good comparison of communication patterns of scrum and Kanban teams.'
