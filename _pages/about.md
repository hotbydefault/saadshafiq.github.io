Being a doctoral researcher at Johannes Kepler University, I primarily focus on Machine Learning applications, with ample experience in Full Stack .Net development, Blockchain technologies, C#, R, and Python. Considering myself an ambitious tech-savvy, I firmly believe in exploring contemporary technologies, and utilising those to enhance the organizational performance.
